# Distributed-Raft-based-Chat-Server
This project implements a distributed chat server using the Raft consensus algorithm for leader election and log replication. It features a simple key-value state machine, handles client commands, and maintains consistency across multiple nodes. The server is built with C++ and utilizes socket programming for network communication.
